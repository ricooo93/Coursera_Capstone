In this project, we will use the venue imformation provided by the Foursquare to help the restaurant owner to decide the best place to start his business. The k-means cluster approach is used to classify the suburbs so that the stakeholder can start the restaurant in a suburb similar to the well developed suburbs with many restaurants.\n",
